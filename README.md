# Carbon-Foot-Print-Forecaster
The topic of interest for our project is ‘Carbon Footprint Estimation’. This project focuses on estimating and analyzing the carbon footprint associated with various entities, including individuals, organizations, events, and products. A carbon footprint measures total greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities. The estimation of carbon footprints plays a vital role in understanding and mitigating climate change by identifying key areas where emissions can be reduced. The subject of carbon footprint estimation is particularly intriguing to us as it has a direct impact on environmental sustainability. By understanding and mitigating carbon emissions, we contribute to environmental sustainability and combat climate change.
Our goal is to develop a predictive model for estimating carbon footprints based on regular activities. We aim to train and compare multiple models to identify the most accurate predictor while gaining insights into the significant contributors to carbon emissions and essentially the areas of improvement. We are aiming to possibly host the best model on a website for real-time predictions to empower consumers to make sustainable choices.


### Data Assumptions and Limitations:
1. The data is synthetically generated based on weights derived from different sources. So, the sources are assumed to be credible, hence the data.
2. The accuracy of the model's predictions will depend heavily on the quality and representativeness of the data.
### Model Assumptions and Limitations:
1. The models assume that the features (data points) are independent of each other.
2. The model assumes that the underlying relationships between features and the target variable remain constant over time.
